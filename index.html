            <h2>Hello! I'm Anthony</h2>
            <p>I am a software developer from Massachussetts currently living in Rhode Island.</p>
            <p>After graduating college, I started my career in the insurance industry. While I've truly enjoyed my experience, I feel ready for a new challenge. I believe my professional experience has allowed me to develop numerous soft skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Effective Communication:</b><br> My experience in the insurance industry involved frequent interaction with clients, colleagues, and managers, honing my ability to communicate clearly and professionally.</li>
                    
                <li><b>Adaptability:</b><br> The insurance industry can be dynamic and subject to frequent changes. I pride myself in embracing change and never shying away from a challenge.</li>
                    
                <li><b>Problem-Solving:</b><br> On a day to day basis I would encounter many different challenges and had to work on finding different solutions to various problems I would encounter. This required me to thoroughly analyze problems, break them down into manageable components, and devise effective solutions to achieve optimal outcomes.</li>
                    
                <li><b>Attention to Detail:</b><br> Accuracy is very important in the insurance industry where accurate documentation is key to good claim handling. I have been able to leverage this strength into writing clean, quality code.</li>
                    
                <li><b>Collaboration:</b><br> I would often find myself collabraiting with different teams, including underwriting, fellow claim professionals, and business analysts. My experience has helped me foster the ability to work effectively within a team and contribute to a common goal.</li>
                    
                <li><b>Time Management:</b><br> There are many deadlines and expectations as a claim professional. I have been able to hone my time management skills by priotizing tasks, asking for help when I'm stuck, and using resources around me efficiently.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>- About me -</h2>
            <p> In 2021, I stumbled accross The Odin Project and a JavaScript Udemy course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. I was instantly hooked, and so began my journey into software development. Since then I have taken numerous college level courses while teaching myself various technologies on the side.</p> 
            <p>As a student at Thinkful, I've been able to reinforce what I already know and learn new concepts. I've enjoyed my journey so far, and can't wait to see what's next!</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I love to brew beer, play with my two dogs, Oscar and Roosevelt, and spend time with my wife, Samantha, and my daughter, Sadie.</p>
